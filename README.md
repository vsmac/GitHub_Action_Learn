# what is github action
GitHub Actions is a feature of GitHub that allows you to automate, customize, and execute software development workflows directly from your GitHub repositories. With GitHub Actions, you can define workflows to build, test, and deploy your code whenever a specific event (like a commit, pull request, or issue) occurs. It enables continuous integration (CI) and continuous deployment (CD), allowing developers to automate tasks like testing, building, and deploying their applications
# in short definition
GitHub Actions is a continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD) platform that allows you to automate your build, test, and deployment pipeline

#  Key Features of GitHub Actions
1, Automation of Workflows    #   Automate tasks such as running tests, building applications, or deploying code when events occur in your repository (e.g., pushing code, opening pull requests) 

2, Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD)   #   Automatically test and deploy your code after each push or pull request

3, Event-driven Workflows   #    Trigger workflows based on events like push, pull_request, issue, or scheduled intervals
4, Customizable    #    You can define your custom workflows using YAML files and run multiple jobs  in sequence

5,Cross-platform Support    #   Supports multiple operating systems like Linux, macOS, and Windows

#  Benefits of GitHub Actions
Easy CI/CD Integration  #   Integrate and automate the CI/CD pipeline directly within your GitHub repository

Custom Automation     #    Customize workflows to automate tasks like code testing, linting, and deployment

Wide Integration     #      Easily integrate with cloud providers, testing tools, and deployment platforms

Parallel Execution    #   Run jobs in parallel to speed up the development process

Predefined Actions    #    Utilize a marketplace of predefined actions to speed up development and avoid reinventing the wheel

#  demo
step -1   #  sign up or login to github.com

step -2   #  create a new repository you can name it anything (github-action)

step -3   #  in the folder create a folder .github/workflows (this folder fixed)

step -4   #  in the folder create a YMAL file with extension .yml

step -5   #  add the workflows content in the file

step -6   #  add,commit and push the changes 

step -7   #  go to main of repository and go to "Action"

step -8   #  select the workflows from left side and check the logs and result
